## About This Repository

This repository showcases my approach to teaching physics and mathematics at all levels—from introductory calculus-based courses to advanced graduate topics in quantum field theory, relativity, and mathematical physics.

**What makes my teaching different?** I believe in two complementary approaches:

### The "Street Fighter" Method 🥋
- **Physics intuition first**: What's *really* happening?
- **Approximate, estimate, visualize**: Build mental models before diving into formalism
- **Shortcuts and insight**: Use Taylor series, dimensional analysis, physical reasoning
- **Speed and efficiency**: Get to the answer fast, understand the physics deeply

### The "Good Boy" Method 📚
- **Rigorous proofs**: Every step justified, every assumption stated
- **Standard textbook approach**: Formal definitions, theorems, careful logic
- **Mathematical completeness**: ε-δ arguments, proper limit procedures
- **Academic correctness**: What you'd find in Landau & Lifshitz or Rudin

**Most importantly:** I show students *both* approaches side-by-side, so they understand not just *what* the answer is, but *why* it works and *how* to think about it.

## Teaching Philosophy

> *"I view teaching physics as a privileged conversation across time and culture—a chance to engage with the elegance of nature, the ingenuity of the human mind, and the pure joy of discovery."*

Key principles:
- **Curiosity over correctness**: The only silly question is the one left unasked
- **Intuition meets rigor**: Connect abstract mathematics with physical insight
- **Humanize science**: Share the stories and struggles of the scientists behind the discoveries
- **Embrace the unknowns**: Real science begins where our models break down
- **Make it joyful**: Learning should be engaging, playful, and deeply satisfying

## Example: Dual-Method Teaching

Here's a sample from my tutoring work showing both approaches to the same problem:

**Problem**: Show that if $f \in C^2$, $\lim_{x→∞} f(x)$ exists and is finite, and $f''$ is bounded, then $\lim_{x→∞} f'(x) = 0$.

**Street Fighter Approach**: "If $f$ is settling down to a horizontal asymptote, and $f''$ is bounded (so $f'$ can't wiggle too much), then $f'$ *must* go to zero—otherwise the function would keep rising or falling forever. The bounded second derivative prevents surprises."

**Good Boy Approach**: Construct the sequence $x_n = n\epsilon/M$, apply the Cauchy property to show $|f(x_{n+1}) - f(x_n)| \leq \epsilon^2/M$, use Mean Value Theorem to get $|f'(c_n)| \leq \epsilon$, then bound $|f'(u) - f'(c_n)| \leq M|u - c_n| \leq \epsilon$, concluding $|f'(u)| \leq 2\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon$.

**Both are correct. Both teach different skills. Students need both.**

## Who I Teach

### The Full Spectrum: Age 8 to PhD

**Yes, really - from elementary school to graduate school.** The same curiosity that drives a PhD student asking "how do we measure astronomical distances?" is present in an 8-year-old asking "why does the balloon stick to the wall?"

### Young Learners (Ages 8-14)
- **Science game companion**: Destroying (I mean *exploring*!) Discovery Science boxes together
- **Competition preparation**: Coached an 11-year-old in Costa Rica for the Math Olympics (she did very well!)
- **Playful discovery**: Making physics and math fun through hands-on experiments, games, and curiosity-driven exploration
- **Building foundations**: Developing intuition and love for science early, before bad habits form

The key? **Same principles, different language.** Kids don't need dumbed-down science - they need science presented with wonder, play, and respect for their intelligence.

### Current Students
- **Elementary/Middle School**: Building curiosity, competition prep, gifted programs
- **High School**: AP Physics, AP Calculus, SAT/ACT prep, science fair mentoring
- **Advanced undergraduates**: Preparing for graduate school, research projects
- **Graduate students**: Master's and PhD level physics and mathematics
- **Engineers**: Applied mathematics, differential equations, numerical methods
- **Parents**: Yes! I've helped parents re-learn math to help their kids

### Topics I Cover
- **Elementary/Middle School**: Math competitions, science experiments, building intuition
- **High School**: AP Physics (all levels), AP Calculus, competition preparation
- **Introductory College**: Calculus-based physics, linear algebra, differential equations
- **Intermediate**: Classical mechanics, E&M, quantum mechanics, mathematical methods
- **Advanced**: QFT, general relativity, topology, differential geometry, Lie groups
- **Specialized**: Seismology, wave propagation, complexity science

## A Note on My Approach

I retired from Venezuela not because I stopped loving science, but because the economic and political situation made it unsustainable. I migrated first to Colombia, then to Texas, taking various jobs—IT, delivery, call centers—to survive while keeping my mind alive through teaching.

Now, I'm rebuilding. My mind is still here, still curious, still asking "but *how* did they really measure that?" And I've found that tools like AI and open-source platforms let me continue what I love most: helping students discover the joy of understanding.

**If you're struggling with physics or math, if you want to truly *understand* rather than just memorize, if you want a teacher who's been in the trenches and knows what it's like to fight for knowledge—let's talk.**

The only silly question is the one left unasked. ☕
